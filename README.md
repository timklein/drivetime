# DriveTime

*DriveTime* is a work in progress. The goal is to pull event data from the Eventful API located at http://api.eventful.com

## Usage

You will need a free Eventful API key. Load this key into the appropriate place in the *config/configVars.example* file, then rename the file *configVars.json*

Currently, loading the homepage will generate a console log in the terminal with the details of today's Denver events from the API and the event titles for page 1 of the results.
